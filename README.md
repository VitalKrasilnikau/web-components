# web-components

Shows component approach for JavaScript UI development using React.js and Polymer.

Type `npm i` and then `npm start` to run the project.

`/React.html` opens React-based version
`/Polymer.html` opens Polymer-based version
`/Handlebars.html` opens Handlebars-based version
and finally `/Index.html` opens pure jQuery version (with spaghetti code)
